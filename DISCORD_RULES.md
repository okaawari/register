# Discord Server Rules

## Introduction
This document is intended for staff and community members. It covers what is and isn’t allowed in the server, along with punishment lengths and more.

## Server Rules

1. Follow Discord's [ToS](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).  
   1. Modified clients are allowed, however abusing them may result in a ban.  
2. Show human decency and use common sense above all else. Keep our server clean and be respectful of others.  
   1. No NSFW. This includes, images, discussions of anything on the topic or "funny" jokes, gore, role playing etc.  
   2. Do not discuss mutes, bans, warnings, or any related topics in public chats. They do not serve as a topic of discussion.  
   3. Refrain from mini modding. You aren't a moderator; use */report* or ping one staff member.  
   4. No slurs, excessive swearing, abuse, bait, harassment, etc.  
3. Do not post malicious links and/or files.  
4. No attempting to bypass, intentionally misinterpret, or find loopholes in the rules.  
   1. A moderator's word is final.  When told to cease, cease.  
5. Refrain from asking for support in non-support channels; you will not receive help there. If you need help, then open a ticket in \#⁠get-help only after you have read the is-a.dev documentation and weren't answered there.  
6. Do not beg for your pull request to be merged or for anything else. Send a link to your pull request *once* in \#pull-requests and patiently wait for a maintainer to get to it. Do *not* ping maintainers to merge pull requests.  
7. Your account is your responsibility.  
   1. If someone else is using your account and breaks these rules, you are responsible.  
   2. If your account gets compromised and gets banned from this server, you may request an unban once you recover it.  
8. Do not attempt to bypass our auto moderation system.  
9. Do not advertise your website, bot or anything else outside of \#showcase.  
   1. Bot invite links are not allowed in \#showcase.  
10. Do not attempt to bypass a punishment on your account.  
    1. This will result in an immediate ban on your account.  
11. Do not use bot commands outside of \#commands.  
12. English only.  
13. Where applicable, this server is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://is-a.dev/terms).

## Moderation Ethic

1. Don't allow yourself to show bias or prejudice. For example, don't “let something slide” solely because the member in question is a respected person within the community. It is not harsh or wrong to call someone out and request somebody to cease something that isn't allowed on the server.  
2. Don't be rude. A problem that is fairly common in the server is that some maintainers are rude to new members. It's ridiculous and sets a horrible example.  
3. Don't abuse your privileges. You were granted them for a reason \- because we trusted you. Please don't abuse that trust and use them for things they aren't meant for, *even as a joke*. Simply put, it's fair to nobody.  
4. Follow the rules. Especially regarding NSFW language and content.  
5. Staff are not immune to punishment. If you are caught breaking the rules, you will be punished, just like any other regular member.

## Staff Team Respect

**Being respectful to each other**:  
We are working together, this is not a competition, so act like it. Everyone here should be mature enough to be able to at least respect each other, regardless of any differences or issues we have between us. If you have an issue with another staff member, take it to DMs, do not share your problems with the rest of the server.

**Regarding roles and permissions**:  
If someone receives a certain role or position that is higher than you, do not go complaining about it. We are old enough to talk it out properly and not have to argue. What matters is that the service and server runs peacefully, all this does is create drama. If you disagree with someone receiving a specific role or permission, you can talk about it in **private** channels, do not talk about these topics outside of staff channels, and try not to argue.
